Project: Simulated Exponential Means and the Central Limit Theorem

**Goal**:  To create simulations of the exponential distribution and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. To compare the theoretical mean and variance with the simulated mean and variance and to show that the distribution is approximately normal.   
**Dataset**: simulated

**Files**:  
*SI course Project pt1.Rmd*: R Markdown document of simulation and visualisation of exponential means and the Central Limit Theorem
